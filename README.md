# Overview
This is a course project of EECS151LB in berkeley, Fall 2024. We built a 3-stage RISC-V cpu and made the frequency up to 100MHz (branch main). For checkpoint3, we sacraficed frequency for CPI (cycle per instruction), and made it nearly 1.

**Checkpoint 1:** 3-Stage RISC-V (rv32ui) Processor Block Design Diagram

**Checkpoint 2:** Fully Functional 3-Stage RISC-V (rv32ui) Processor

**Checkpoint 3:** Branch Predictor using Branch History Table

**Checkpoint 4:** Processor Optimization
